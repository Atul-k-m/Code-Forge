<h2>Getting Started 🚀</h2>

<p>Have no idea about Hacktoberfest? Don't know about Git/Github? Want to know more about the Code-Forge Repository and Hacktoberfest?</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://dev.to/kappuccino111/iit-mandi-students-lets-fortify-our-opensource-armour-together-opd">Getting Started Guide</a>. Here you will get everything you need for getting started in your open source journey.
We have things specially curated for you 😀</p>

<h2>Description 📚</h2>

<p style="font-size: 14px;">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>3 Folders</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Folder 1: Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>
                    <p>Contains basic code for various data structures, such as Convex Hull Algorithms.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Folder 2: Machine Learning Algorithms</strong>
                    <p>Contains basic code for machine learning algorithms.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Folder 3: Applications Folder</strong>
                    <p>This folder is subdivided into two subfolders:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Folder 3A: DSA Applications</strong>
                            <p>Contains applications of the data structures.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Folder 3B: ML Applications</strong>
                            <p>Contains applications of machine learning algorithms.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Tasks ✅</h2>

<p>You have to make PR's for the basic codes of Computational/ML Algorithms (in Folder 1/ Folder 2) and the Application based on the algorithm that you have provided (in Folder 1/Folder 2) in subfolders (Folder 3A/Folder 3B) in Folder 3. Only 2 PRs for Computational/ML Algorithmic contributions will be accepted, and the rest 2 should be for applications based on the algorithms.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer 📝</h2>

<p>This repository is only open to IIT Mandi Students, starting their Open Source Journey. Please make sure that you are an IIT Mandi Student with a valid Enrollment No.</p>
