Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is a method for finding the shortest path between nodes in an undirected graph.
Algorithm Steps:-
A. Using Priority Queue
Question:- Why use priority queue? Becuase we always want minimum dist at first. 
1. Create a distance array and initialize all the elements of distance array as infinite or a very big number except the source node.
2. Create a priority queue in which we will storing the {dist, node}.
3. Now store the source node with dist equal zero in the priority queue.
4. Now iterate through the priority queue till it becomes empty and store the dist and node in variables named dis and node respectively andd pop the element 
from the priority queue.
5. Now iterate through adjacent element of the node as adjnode and edgeweight to reach from node to adjnode if the 
edgeweight+ dis(dist to reach the node) is less than the dist[adjnode] update the dist[adjnode] and push {dist[adjnode],adjnode} in the 
priority queue.
6. Return the distance array.

B. Using Set
Why set? Because it stores unique elements and the smallest element at the top(Stores element in ascending order). 
** Set has the liberty to erase the elements so if the element is already visited at a distance greater than the dis+edgeweight then 
the set can directly erase that elemnt and node from the set that will save the further iterations which was not possible in priority queue.
Algorithm steps:-
Similar to that we have in priority queue 1 extra step is added to erase the pair if the distance stored in the array is greater than the 
distance that we find by ierating. 

Time Complexity: O(Elog(V)), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity: O(|E|+|V|), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes.
